The GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array is a single array representing 14,500 well-characterized human genes that can be used to explore human biology and disease processes.
Provides coverage of well-substantiated genes in the transcribed human genome on a single array
Analyzes the expression level of 18,400 transcripts and variants, including 14,500 well-characterized human genes
Comprised of more than 22,000 probe sets and 500,000 distinct oligonucleotide features
All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133A Array are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array
Sequences used in the design of the array were selected from GenBankÂ®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001) and then were refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human genome database (April 2001 release).

All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 are included on the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBankÂ«, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 107, June 2002) and then refined by analysis and comparison with the publicly available draft assembly of the mouse genome from the Whitehead Institute for Genome Research (MGSC, April 2002).

One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>

Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>

      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>

First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
To mimic the natural course of S. aureus infection in humans, which typically arises from a primary focus of infection and disseminates to other sites, we employed an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of infection in our animal model.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain (Sanger 476) and three methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, and MW2) were used.  Overnight S. aureus cultures were inoculated into fresh tryptic soy broth and incubated aerobically at 30Â°C to log-phase growth (optical density 600nm of ~1.0) (Rice et al., 2003).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).  E. coli O18:K1:H7 was grown at 30Â°C overnight in Luria Bertani broth (Miller et al., 1972).  Cultures were then diluted with fresh medium and grown for an additional 1 to 2 hours.  Upon reaching log phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from mouse blood using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Globin mRNA was removed from whole blood RNA using the Globinclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). All samples passed the quality criteria of the Agilent Bioanalyzer and were used for microarray analysis. Since the total RNA yield of many samples was low, one round of linear amplification was performed for all samples using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 0.5 ug total RNA (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Biotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays for 16 hours at 45Â°C according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Arrays were then washed and labeled with streptavidinphycoerythrin (strep-PE), and the signal was amplified using biotinylated antistreptavidin followed by another round of staining with strep-PE. These steps were performed on the Affymetrix fluidics station according to the recommended protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Amplification and microarray hybridization were performed at the Duke University Microarray Core. Labeled gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner 7G (Santa Clara, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy previously outlined and utilized (Zaas et al., 2010). First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype (Carvalho et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007). Second, factors were then used to build a probit regression with variable selection model (Hans et al., 2007) trained to identify S. aureus infection.

Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Fluorescent images were detected in an GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 and expression data was extracted using the GeneChip Operating System v 1.1 (Affymetrix).  All GeneChips were scaled to a median intensity setting of 500.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Fluorescent images were detected in an GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 and expression data was extracted using the GeneChip Operating System v 1.1 (Affymetrix).  All GeneChips were scaled to a median intensity setting of 500.

    <Description>
Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

    <Description>
Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Fluorescent images were detected in an GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 and expression data was extracted using the GeneChip Operating System v 1.1 (Affymetrix).  All GeneChips were scaled to a median intensity setting of 500.

    <Description>
Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Fluorescent images were detected in an GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 and expression data was extracted using the GeneChip Operating System v 1.1 (Affymetrix).  All GeneChips were scaled to a median intensity setting of 500.

    <Description>
Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

    <Description>
Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Fluorescent images were detected in an GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 and expression data was extracted using the GeneChip Operating System v 1.1 (Affymetrix).  All GeneChips were scaled to a median intensity setting of 500.

    <Description>
Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

    <Description>
Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Fluorescent images were detected in an GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 and expression data was extracted using the GeneChip Operating System v 1.1 (Affymetrix).  All GeneChips were scaled to a median intensity setting of 500.

    <Description>
Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol including DNase treatment.  Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Target was prepared and hybridized according to the &quot;Affymetrix Technical Manual&quot;. The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99Â°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45Â°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge. The GeneChip array was incubated at 42Â°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed with a series of nonstringent (25Â°C) and stringent (50Â°C) solutions containing variable amounts of MES, Tween20 and SSPE. The microarrays were then stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified using a biotinylated antibody solution.

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes.

Following isolation, RNA quantity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A set of four peptide nuleic acid (PNA) oligomers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with sequences complimentary to globin mRNA were added to 2.5 ug of total RNA to reduce globin RNA transcription, then converted into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT)24 primer that contains T7 promoter sequences (GenSet).   After first strand synthesis, residual RNA was degraded by the addition of RNaseH and a double-stranded cDNA molecule was generated using DNA Polymerase I and DNA Ligase. The cDNA was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.

The cDNA products were incubated with T7 RNA Polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using an In Vitro Transcription kit (Affymetrix). The resultant cRNA product was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and quantified with a spectrophotometer. The cRNA target (20ug) was incubated at 94ÂºC for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (Tris, MgOAc, KOAc).  The fragmented cRNA was diluted in hybridization buffer (MES, NaCl, EDTA, Tween 20, Herring Sperm DNA, Acetylated BSA) containing biotin-labeled OligoB2 and Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (Affymetrix).

Enrollment protocol: Subjects were enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC; Durham, NC) as part of a prospective, NIH-sponsored study to develop novel diagnostic tests for severe sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869).  Enrolled patients had a known or suspected infection a exhibited two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an imminently terminal co-morbid condition, advanced AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 50), were receiving antibiotics prior to enrollment, or were enrolled in another clinical trial. Subjects in the current report had culture-confirmed monomicrobial BSI due to S. aureus (n=26; median age 55 years; range 40-91) or E. coli (n=14; median age 51.5 years; range 25-91). Uninfected controls (n=44; median age 26 years; range 20-59) were enrolled at DUMC as part of study investigating the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy.

    <Data-Processing>
Data processing was conducted using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software.   Microarray data was analyzed in two steps following the analysis strategy.  First, a Bayesian sparse factor model was fit to the expression data without regard to phenotype. Second, factors were then used as independent variables to build a penalized binary regression with variable selection model trained to identify S. aureus infection. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. This approach also allows for model averaging, which properly accounts for uncertainty in the choice of predictors and typically outperforms the single best model in predictive accuracy. Genes were filtered for analysis using non-specific filtering for genes with high mean expression and high variance across samples. Samples with a high number of outlying genes were removed during the factor analysis. Mice were batched into discrete experiments with each experiment containing the relevant controls to avoid confounding. Using the same murine experimental data, another classifier was derived to classify methicillin-resistant vs. methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection. The methodology was otherwise the same as that described above.  We fit a factor model on the human data independently from the mouse data. The factor model was fit to 8,892 genes after non-specific filtering to remove unexpressed and uniformly expressed genes. The factor model was trained on the 95 samples from three batches of expression data, and this resulted in 77 factors. These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

These 77 factors were then projected onto the full data set with the goal of distinguishing S. aureus BSI from healthy controls or E. coli BSI. Leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized in order to control for overfitting of the penalized binary regression model. In order to minimize issues with overfitting, batch was not included in the regression models. Matlab scripts to perform these operations are available.

    <Summary>
Staphylococcus aureus causes a spectrum of human infection. Diagnostic delays and uncertainty lead to treatment delays and inappropriate antibiotic use. A growing literature suggests the hostâs inflammatory response to the pathogen represents a potential tool to improve upon current diagnostics. The hypothesis of this study is that the host responds differently to S. aureus than to E. coli infection in a quantifiable way, providing a new diagnostic avenue. This study uses Bayesian sparse factor modeling and penalized binary regression to define peripheral blood gene-expression classifiers of murine and human S. aureus infection. The murine-derived classifier distinguished S. aureus infection from healthy controls and Escherichia coli-infected mice across a range of conditions (mouse and bacterial strain, time post infection) and was validated in outbred mice (AUC&gt;0.97). A S. aureus classifier derived from a cohort of 95 human subjects distinguished S. aureus blood stream infection (BSI) from healthy subjects (AUC 0.99) and E. coli BSI (AUC 0.82). Murine and human responses to S. aureus infection share common biological pathways, allowing the murine model to classify S. aureus BSI in humans (AUC 0.84). Both murine and human S. aureus classifiers were validated in an independent human cohort (AUC 0.95 and 0.94, respectively).  The approach described here lends insight into the conserved and disparate pathways utilized by mice and humans in response to these infections.  Furthermore, this study advances our understanding of S. aureus infection; the host response to it; and identifies new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
To create a host gene expression-based classifier for S. aureus infection, mice from a variety of experimental conditions were utilized.  Seven different strains of inbred mice (n=187 total) were challenged with four different S. aureus strains via intraperitoneal inoculation and sacrificed at various time points as described in Methods.  The comparator group for model derivation included 50 A/J or C57BL/6J mice inoculated with E. coli (O18:K1:H7) as well as 54 uninfected mice. Next, the murine S. aureus classifier was externally validated in outbred CD-1 mice with S. aureus infection (Sanger 476 or USA300), E. coli infection (O18:K1:H7), or uninfected controls (10 animals per condition).   Method: All experiments were performed on mice 6-8 weeks old.  For the murine S. aureus predictor, seven inbred mouse strains (3 mice/strain: 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and NOD/LtJ) were IP inoculated with 107 CFU/g of S. aureus Sanger476, euthanized at 2h after injection, and bled. This was repeated using four different S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, MW2, and Sanger476) in A/J mice (n=3 per S. aureus strain). For time series experiments, both A/J and C57BL/6J mouse strains were IP inoculated with S. aureus Sanger476 as above, and sacrificed at 2, 4, 6, and 12h after injection (n=5 per time point).
