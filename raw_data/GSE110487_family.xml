Peripheral blood was collected in EDTA tubes at T1 and T2 and stored at -20°C after adding 400µl of 2X Denaturing solution (Ambion, USA).Total RNA was extracted from 800 µl of blood with MirVana Paris Kit and treated with Turbo DNA-free Kit (Ambion, USA). RNA Quality was assessed on Agilent Bioanalyzer with the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and samples were considered suitable for processing if RNA Integrity Number was greater than 7.5
Sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Globin Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using 800 ng of total RNA

    <Title>Whole blood transcriptome analysis of Septic shock patients according to early therapy response</Title>

    <Summary>
Septic shock is the most severe complication of sepsis, associated with high mortality. The patient’s response to supportive therapy is very heterogeneous and the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. In order to identify which are the actors (genes and pathways) that play a role in establishing the response, we investigate the whole blood transcriptome in septic shock patients with positive and negative responses to early supportive hemodynamic therapy, assessed by changes in SOFA scores within the first 48 hours from ICU admission. We pinpointed genes and pathways that are differently modulated and enriched respectively within 48hrs between responders and non-responders.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We analyzed 31 patients (17 Responders and 14 Not Responders to early therapy). For each patient, 2 samples were collected. In particular the first sample (T1) collected within 16 hours from ICU admission whereas the second (T2) collected within 48 hours from ICU admission. Experimental groups (Responders and Not Responders) are defined accordingly with SOFA scores improvements within 48 hours.
