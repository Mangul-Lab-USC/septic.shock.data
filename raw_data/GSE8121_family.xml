Complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set plus 6,500 additional genes for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts
All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBankÂ®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001) and then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human genome database (April 2001 release).
In addition, there are 9,921 new probe sets representing approximately 6,500 new genes. These gene sequences were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 159, January 25, 2003) and refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the NCBI human genome assembly (Build 31).

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

1) Control day 1; 2) Septic shock day 1; 3) Septic shock day 3 (same patient cohort as Septic shock day 1).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

1) Control day 1; 2) Septic shock day 1; 3) Septic shock day 3 (same patient cohort as Septic shock day 1).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

1) Control day 1; 2) Septic shock day 1; 3) Septic shock day 3 (same patient cohort as Septic shock day 1).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

1) Control day 1; 2) Septic shock day 1; 3) Septic shock day 3 (same patient cohort as Septic shock day 1).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

1) Control day 1; 2) Septic shock day 1; 3) Septic shock day 3 (same patient cohort as Septic shock day 1).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm.
Fluidics:  Wash and Stain probe arrays using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) utilizing the fluidics protocol EukGE-WS2v5_450. Arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin [Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR] and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG [Sigma-Aldrich] and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA], as described in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Manual.

1) Control day 1; 2) Septic shock day 1; 3) Septic shock day 3 (same patient cohort as Septic shock day 1).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500. Genechip Operating Software 1v4 (Affymetrix) was then used to generate CEL files from each experiment, which were then imported into GeneSpring for all further data analysis.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

The image file was captured on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and initially processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix).
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
Each array was normalized the same. Global scaling is used by adjusting the average intensity or signal value of each probe array to the same Target Intensity Value (TGV) of 1500.

    <Summary>
In an ongoing translational research program involving microarray-based expression profiles in pediatric septic shock, we have now conducted longitudinal studies focused on the temporal expression profiles of canonical signaling pathways and gene networks. Genome-level expression profiles were generated from whole blood-derived RNA samples of children with septic shock (n = 30 individual patients) corresponding to days 1 and 3 of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. Based on sequential statistical and expression filters, day 1 and day 3 of septic shock were characterized by differential regulation of 2,142 and 2,504 gene probes, respectively, relative to normal control patients. Venn analysis demonstrated 239 unique genes in the day 1 data set, 598 unique genes in the day 3 data set, and 1,906 genes common to both data sets. Analyses targeted toward derivation of biological function from these data sets demonstrated time-dependent, differential regulation of genes involved in multiple canonical signaling pathways and gene networks primarily related to immunity and inflammation. Notably, multiple and distinct gene networks involving T cell- and MHC antigen-related biological processes were persistently downregulated from day 1 to day 3. Further analyses demonstrated large scale and persistent downregulation of genes corresponding to functional annotations related to zinc homeostasis. These data represent the largest reported cohort of patients with septic shock, which has undergone longitudinal genome-level expression profiling. The data further advance our genome-level understanding of pediatric septic shock and support novel hypotheses that can be readily tested at both the experimental and translational levels.
