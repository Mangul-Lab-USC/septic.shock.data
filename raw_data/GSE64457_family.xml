Complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set plus 6,500 additional genes for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts
All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBank®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001) and then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human genome database (April 2001 release).
In addition, there are 9,921 new probe sets representing approximately 6,500 new genes. These gene sequences were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 159, January 25, 2003) and refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the NCBI human genome assembly (Build 31).

Blood samples were first diluted (1:2) with phosphate-buffered saline, layered over Ficoll-Paque (Biochrom, Germany) and centrifuged. Neutrophils were then aspirated and collected; after a washing step and red blood cell lysis (Versalyse, Beckman Coulter), viability and purity were determined by flow cytometry using LDS 751 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Human neutrophil Enrichment Kit (Stem Cell, Canada) was used to purify neutrophils following the manufacturer’s recommendations. 5.107 cells/well (dilution in recommended buffer: PBS + 2% Fetal Bovine Serum or 0.5% BSA+ 1mM EDTA) were plated into a 96-untreated U-bottom plate (Corning, NY) and 50µl/ml of EasySep™ Human Enrichment Cocktail were added for 10 min. Incubation with 100µl/ml of EasySep™ D Magnetic Particles for 5 min preceded the action held by the EasyPlate™ magnet when placing the plate onto the magnet for 10 min. The supernatant contained the enriched neutrophils. Granulocytes were suspended in Qiagen RLT Buffer (Qiagen, the Netherlands) containing 1% B-mercaptoethanol and stored at -80°C until RNA isolation.

    <Data-Processing>
Normalization processing and quality controls were performed using R/Bioconductor (R version 3.0.0 (2013-04-03)) (R Development Core Team – 2009). We performed quality controls at both probe and probeset levels). Raw expression profiles were normalized using the GC-RMA algorithm (R/Bioconductor). To reduce the number of probeset, we applied a filtering process based on the MAS5.0 p-values.

Blood samples were first diluted (1:2) with phosphate-buffered saline, layered over Ficoll-Paque (Biochrom, Germany) and centrifuged. Neutrophils were then aspirated and collected; after a washing step and red blood cell lysis (Versalyse, Beckman Coulter), viability and purity were determined by flow cytometry using LDS 751 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Human neutrophil Enrichment Kit (Stem Cell, Canada) was used to purify neutrophils following the manufacturer’s recommendations. 5.107 cells/well (dilution in recommended buffer: PBS + 2% Fetal Bovine Serum or 0.5% BSA+ 1mM EDTA) were plated into a 96-untreated U-bottom plate (Corning, NY) and 50µl/ml of EasySep™ Human Enrichment Cocktail were added for 10 min. Incubation with 100µl/ml of EasySep™ D Magnetic Particles for 5 min preceded the action held by the EasyPlate™ magnet when placing the plate onto the magnet for 10 min. The supernatant contained the enriched neutrophils. Granulocytes were suspended in Qiagen RLT Buffer (Qiagen, the Netherlands) containing 1% B-mercaptoethanol and stored at -80°C until RNA isolation.

    <Data-Processing>
Normalization processing and quality controls were performed using R/Bioconductor (R version 3.0.0 (2013-04-03)) (R Development Core Team – 2009). We performed quality controls at both probe and probeset levels). Raw expression profiles were normalized using the GC-RMA algorithm (R/Bioconductor). To reduce the number of probeset, we applied a filtering process based on the MAS5.0 p-values.

    <Data-Processing>
Normalization processing and quality controls were performed using R/Bioconductor (R version 3.0.0 (2013-04-03)) (R Development Core Team – 2009). We performed quality controls at both probe and probeset levels). Raw expression profiles were normalized using the GC-RMA algorithm (R/Bioconductor). To reduce the number of probeset, we applied a filtering process based on the MAS5.0 p-values.

Blood samples were first diluted (1:2) with phosphate-buffered saline, layered over Ficoll-Paque (Biochrom, Germany) and centrifuged. Neutrophils were then aspirated and collected; after a washing step and red blood cell lysis (Versalyse, Beckman Coulter), viability and purity were determined by flow cytometry using LDS 751 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Human neutrophil Enrichment Kit (Stem Cell, Canada) was used to purify neutrophils following the manufacturer’s recommendations. 5.107 cells/well (dilution in recommended buffer: PBS + 2% Fetal Bovine Serum or 0.5% BSA+ 1mM EDTA) were plated into a 96-untreated U-bottom plate (Corning, NY) and 50µl/ml of EasySep™ Human Enrichment Cocktail were added for 10 min. Incubation with 100µl/ml of EasySep™ D Magnetic Particles for 5 min preceded the action held by the EasyPlate™ magnet when placing the plate onto the magnet for 10 min. The supernatant contained the enriched neutrophils. Granulocytes were suspended in Qiagen RLT Buffer (Qiagen, the Netherlands) containing 1% B-mercaptoethanol and stored at -80°C until RNA isolation.

Blood samples were first diluted (1:2) with phosphate-buffered saline, layered over Ficoll-Paque (Biochrom, Germany) and centrifuged. Neutrophils were then aspirated and collected; after a washing step and red blood cell lysis (Versalyse, Beckman Coulter), viability and purity were determined by flow cytometry using LDS 751 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Human neutrophil Enrichment Kit (Stem Cell, Canada) was used to purify neutrophils following the manufacturer’s recommendations. 5.107 cells/well (dilution in recommended buffer: PBS + 2% Fetal Bovine Serum or 0.5% BSA+ 1mM EDTA) were plated into a 96-untreated U-bottom plate (Corning, NY) and 50µl/ml of EasySep™ Human Enrichment Cocktail were added for 10 min. Incubation with 100µl/ml of EasySep™ D Magnetic Particles for 5 min preceded the action held by the EasyPlate™ magnet when placing the plate onto the magnet for 10 min. The supernatant contained the enriched neutrophils. Granulocytes were suspended in Qiagen RLT Buffer (Qiagen, the Netherlands) containing 1% B-mercaptoethanol and stored at -80°C until RNA isolation.

RNA from purified neutrophils
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Normalization processing and quality controls were performed using R/Bioconductor (R version 3.0.0 (2013-04-03)) (R Development Core Team – 2009). We performed quality controls at both probe and probeset levels). Raw expression profiles were normalized using the GC-RMA algorithm (R/Bioconductor). To reduce the number of probeset, we applied a filtering process based on the MAS5.0 p-values.

Blood samples were first diluted (1:2) with phosphate-buffered saline, layered over Ficoll-Paque (Biochrom, Germany) and centrifuged. Neutrophils were then aspirated and collected; after a washing step and red blood cell lysis (Versalyse, Beckman Coulter), viability and purity were determined by flow cytometry using LDS 751 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Human neutrophil Enrichment Kit (Stem Cell, Canada) was used to purify neutrophils following the manufacturer’s recommendations. 5.107 cells/well (dilution in recommended buffer: PBS + 2% Fetal Bovine Serum or 0.5% BSA+ 1mM EDTA) were plated into a 96-untreated U-bottom plate (Corning, NY) and 50µl/ml of EasySep™ Human Enrichment Cocktail were added for 10 min. Incubation with 100µl/ml of EasySep™ D Magnetic Particles for 5 min preceded the action held by the EasyPlate™ magnet when placing the plate onto the magnet for 10 min. The supernatant contained the enriched neutrophils. Granulocytes were suspended in Qiagen RLT Buffer (Qiagen, the Netherlands) containing 1% B-mercaptoethanol and stored at -80°C until RNA isolation.

    <Title>Marked alterations of neutrophil functions during sepsis-induced immunosuppression</Title>

    <Pubmed-ID>26224052</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Background: Severe septic syndromes deeply impair innate and adaptive immunity. While neutrophils represent the first line of defense against infection, little is known about their phenotype and functions during sepsis-induced immunosuppression. The objective of this study was thus to perform for the first time a global evaluation of neutrophil alterations in immunosuppressed septic patients based on phenotypic, functional and transcriptomic studies. In addition, the potential association of these parameters and deleterious outcomes was assessed.
Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 9 septic shock patients at D3-4 and D6-8 presenting with features of sepsis-induced immunosuppression and compared to 8 healthy controls.
Results: In order to get on overview of potential neutrophil alterations after sepsis, we performed transcriptomic analyses on purified neutrophils from 9 septic shock patients and 8 healthy volunteers. For each time point, comparisons were made between patients and controls. Venn diagrams indicated that 364 up-regulated genes and 328 down-regulated genes were common between the two analyses (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Interestingly, most of the differentially expressed genes are involved in cell maturation (CD177), apoptosis (STK4, Caspase 8), cell recruitment and chemotaxis (CD44, TPST, MMP9, CREB1), and antimicrobial properties (ARG1, STOM, ADAM9, CD63, YKL40) of neutrophils.
Conclusions: The aim of the current study was to perform an extensive investigation of neutrophil alterations during sepsis-induced immunosuppression through phenotypic, functional and transcriptomic studies. Notably, transcriptomic study on purified neutrophils revealed differentially expressed genes between septic patients and healthy volunteers.
