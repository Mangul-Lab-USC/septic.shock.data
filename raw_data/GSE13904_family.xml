Complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set plus 6,500 additional genes for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts
All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBankÂ®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001) and then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human genome database (April 2001 release).
In addition, there are 9,921 new probe sets representing approximately 6,500 new genes. These gene sequences were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 159, January 25, 2003) and refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the NCBI human genome assembly (Build 31).

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.

Commercial Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip CEL  files were subjected to RMA  normalization using  the  GeneSpring GX 7.1.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and beta-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between 1 and 3. Eukaryotic Spike controls were used to determine that the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used for normalization, clustering, filtering, and statistical analyses. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls.
