    <Description>
The HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip provides high throughput processing of 12 samples per BeadChip without the need for expensive, specialized automation. The BeadChip is designed to support flexible usage across a wide-spectrum of experiments.

The updated content on the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips provides more biologically meaningful results through genome-wide transcriptional coverage of well-characterized genes, gene candidates, and splice variants.

Each array on the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip targets more than 31,000 annotated genes with more than 47,000 probes derived from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Reference Sequence (NCBI) RefSeq Release 38 (November 7, 2009) and other sources.

Please use the GEO Data Submission Report Plug-in v1.0 for Gene Expression which may be downloaded from https://icom.illumina.com/icom/software.ilmn?id=234 to format the normalized and raw data.  These should be submitted as part of a GEOarchive.  Instructions for assembling a GEOarchive may be found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/spreadsheet.html

Blood was collected and stored in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX) to stabilize intracellular RNA until further use. RNA isolation was performed using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX) corresponding to the manufacturer’s instruction. High quality of isolated RNA was proven by RNA integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 8.2 to 9.5.

Blood was collected and stored in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX) to stabilize intracellular RNA until further use. RNA isolation was performed using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX) corresponding to the manufacturer’s instruction. High quality of isolated RNA was proven by RNA integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 8.2 to 9.5.

A total of 500 ng isolated RNA was immediately further processed to synthesize biotin-labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) using the Illumina® TotalPrep™ RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion). All procedures were carried out as proposed in the manufacturer’s protocol. Concentration as well as quality of cRNA were verified via the NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer system (Thermo Scientific).

Blood was collected and stored in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX) to stabilize intracellular RNA until further use. RNA isolation was performed using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX) corresponding to the manufacturer’s instruction. High quality of isolated RNA was proven by RNA integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 8.2 to 9.5.

A total of 500 ng isolated RNA was immediately further processed to synthesize biotin-labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) using the Illumina® TotalPrep™ RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion). All procedures were carried out as proposed in the manufacturer’s protocol. Concentration as well as quality of cRNA were verified via the NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer system (Thermo Scientific).

Blood was collected and stored in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX) to stabilize intracellular RNA until further use. RNA isolation was performed using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX) corresponding to the manufacturer’s instruction. High quality of isolated RNA was proven by RNA integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 8.2 to 9.5.

A total of 500 ng isolated RNA was immediately further processed to synthesize biotin-labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) using the Illumina® TotalPrep™ RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion). All procedures were carried out as proposed in the manufacturer’s protocol. Concentration as well as quality of cRNA were verified via the NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer system (Thermo Scientific).

Blood was collected and stored in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX) to stabilize intracellular RNA until further use. RNA isolation was performed using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX) corresponding to the manufacturer’s instruction. High quality of isolated RNA was proven by RNA integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 8.2 to 9.5.

Blood was collected and stored in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX) to stabilize intracellular RNA until further use. RNA isolation was performed using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX) corresponding to the manufacturer’s instruction. High quality of isolated RNA was proven by RNA integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 8.2 to 9.5.

A total of 500 ng isolated RNA was immediately further processed to synthesize biotin-labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) using the Illumina® TotalPrep™ RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion). All procedures were carried out as proposed in the manufacturer’s protocol. Concentration as well as quality of cRNA were verified via the NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer system (Thermo Scientific).

Blood was collected and stored in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX) to stabilize intracellular RNA until further use. RNA isolation was performed using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX) corresponding to the manufacturer’s instruction. High quality of isolated RNA was proven by RNA integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 8.2 to 9.5.

    <Summary>
Sepsis is a clinical syndrome that can be caused by bacteria or fungi. Early knowledge on the nature of the causative agent is a prerequisite for targeted anti-microbial therapy. Besides currently used detection methods like blood culture and PCR-based assays, the analysis of the transcriptional response of the host to infecting organisms holds great promise. In this study, we aim to examine the transcriptional footprint of infections caused by the bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and the fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus in a human whole-blood model. Moreover, we use the expression information to build a random forest classifier to determine if the pathogen is bacterial, fungal or neither of the two. After normalizing the transcription intensities using stably expressed reference genes, we filtered the gene set for biomarkers of bacterial or fungal blood infections. This selection is based on differential expression and an additional gene relevance measure. In this way, we identified 38 biomarker genes, including IL6, SOCS3, and IRG1 which were already associated to sepsis by other studies. Using these genes, we trained the classifier and assessed its performance. It yielded a 96% accuracy (sensitivities &gt;93%, specificities &gt;97%) for a 10-fold stratified cross-validation and a 92% accuracy (sensitivities and specificities &gt;83%) for an additional dataset comprising Cryptococcus neoformans infections. Furthermore, the noise-robustness of the classifier suggests high rates of correct class predictions on datasets of new species. In conclusion, this genome-wide approach demonstrates an effective feature selection process in combination with the construction of a well-performing classification model. Further analyses of genes with pathogen-dependent expression patterns can provide insights into the systemic host responses, which may lead to new anti-microbial therapeutic advances.
