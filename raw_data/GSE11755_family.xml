Complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set plus 6,500 additional genes for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts
All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBankÂ®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001) and then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human genome database (April 2001 release).
In addition, there are 9,921 new probe sets representing approximately 6,500 new genes. These gene sequences were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 159, January 25, 2003) and refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the NCBI human genome assembly (Build 31).

RNA isolation from leukocyte subsets. One ml of whole blood was used for
immediate RNA isolation (internal validation step) using QIAamp RNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The remaining 10 ml whole blood was used to perform a ficoll density separation using Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway). Granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and immediately frozen at -80Â°C. From the PBMCs, CD14-positive cells (here referred to as monocytes) and CD14-negative cells, hence enriched for B- and T-cells (and therefore here referred to as lymphocytes) were separated using autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The integrity of the RNA was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano assay kit on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Micro-array analysis. Background was removed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and probe intensity levels were quantile normalized. Array groups were compared based on the perfect match (PM) probe intensity levels only, by performing a per-probeset two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, with factors âprobeâ and âgroupâ). This results in average expression levels for each probeset in each group, as well as raw p-values for the significance of the difference between the groups. The latter were adjusted for multiple testing using Â¬Å idÃ¡k step-up adjustment to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of incorrectly calling at least one probeset differentially expressed. All differences with adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The Ingenuity program was used to analyse what pathophysiological pathways were differentially expressed between patients at t=0 and controls (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; 5.5.1-1002).

From the PBMCs, CD14-positive cells (here referred to as monocytes) and CD14-negative cells, hence enriched for B- and T-cells (and therefore here referred to as lymphocytes) were separated using autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The integrity of the RNA was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano assay kit on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Micro-array analysis. Background was removed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and probe intensity levels were quantile normalized. Array groups were compared based on the perfect match (PM) probe intensity levels only, by performing a per-probeset two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, with factors âprobeâ and âgroupâ). This results in average expression levels for each probeset in each group, as well as raw p-values for the significance of the difference between the groups. The latter were adjusted for multiple testing using Â¬Å idÃ¡k step-up adjustment to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of incorrectly calling at least one probeset differentially expressed. All differences with adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The Ingenuity program was used to analyse what pathophysiological pathways were differentially expressed between patients at t=0 and controls (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; 5.5.1-1002).

All differences with adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The Ingenuity program was used to analyse what pathophysiological pathways were differentially expressed between patients at t=0 and controls (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; 5.5.1-1002).

RNA isolation from leukocyte subsets. One ml of whole blood was used for
immediate RNA isolation (internal validation step) using QIAamp RNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The remaining 10 ml whole blood was used to perform a ficoll density separation using Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway). Granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and immediately frozen at -80Â°C. From the PBMCs, CD14-positive cells (here referred to as monocytes) and CD14-negative cells, hence enriched for B- and T-cells (and therefore here referred to as lymphocytes) were separated using autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The integrity of the RNA was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano assay kit on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Micro-array analysis. Background was removed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and probe intensity levels were quantile normalized. Array groups were compared based on the perfect match (PM) probe intensity levels only, by performing a per-probeset two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, with factors âprobeâ and âgroupâ). This results in average expression levels for each probeset in each group, as well as raw p-values for the significance of the difference between the groups. The latter were adjusted for multiple testing using Â¬Å idÃ¡k step-up adjustment to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of incorrectly calling at least one probeset differentially expressed.

RNA isolation from leukocyte subsets. One ml of whole blood was used for
immediate RNA isolation (internal validation step) using QIAamp RNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The remaining 10 ml whole blood was used to perform a ficoll density separation using Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway). Granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and immediately frozen at -80Â°C. From the PBMCs, CD14-positive cells (here referred to as monocytes) and CD14-negative cells, hence enriched for B- and T-cells (and therefore here referred to as lymphocytes) were separated using autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The integrity of the RNA was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano assay kit on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Micro-array analysis. Background was removed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and probe intensity levels were quantile normalized. Array groups were compared based on the perfect match (PM) probe intensity levels only, by performing a per-probeset two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, with factors âprobeâ and âgroupâ). This results in average expression levels for each probeset in each group, as well as raw p-values for the significance of the difference between the groups. The latter were adjusted for multiple testing using Â¬Å idÃ¡k step-up adjustment to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of incorrectly calling at least one probeset differentially expressed. All differences with adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The Ingenuity program was used to analyse what pathophysiological pathways were differentially expressed between patients at t=0 and controls (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; 5.5.1-1002).

From the PBMCs, CD14-positive cells (here referred to as monocytes) and CD14-negative cells, hence enriched for B- and T-cells (and therefore here referred to as lymphocytes) were separated using autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The integrity of the RNA was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano assay kit on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Micro-array analysis. Background was removed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and probe intensity levels were quantile normalized. Array groups were compared based on the perfect match (PM) probe intensity levels only, by performing a per-probeset two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, with factors âprobeâ and âgroupâ). This results in average expression levels for each probeset in each group, as well as raw p-values for the significance of the difference between the groups. The latter were adjusted for multiple testing using Â¬Å idÃ¡k step-up adjustment to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of incorrectly calling at least one probeset differentially expressed. All differences with adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The Ingenuity program was used to analyse what pathophysiological pathways were differentially expressed between patients at t=0 and controls (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; 5.5.1-1002).

All differences with adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The Ingenuity program was used to analyse what pathophysiological pathways were differentially expressed between patients at t=0 and controls (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; 5.5.1-1002).

RNA isolation from leukocyte subsets. One ml of whole blood was used for
immediate RNA isolation (internal validation step) using QIAamp RNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The remaining 10 ml whole blood was used to perform a ficoll density separation using Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway). Granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and immediately frozen at -80Â°C. From the PBMCs, CD14-positive cells (here referred to as monocytes) and CD14-negative cells, hence enriched for B- and T-cells (and therefore here referred to as lymphocytes) were separated using autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The integrity of the RNA was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano assay kit on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Micro-array analysis. Background was removed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and probe intensity levels were quantile normalized. Array groups were compared based on the perfect match (PM) probe intensity levels only, by performing a per-probeset two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, with factors âprobeâ and âgroupâ). This results in average expression levels for each probeset in each group, as well as raw p-values for the significance of the difference between the groups. The latter were adjusted for multiple testing using Â¬Å idÃ¡k step-up adjustment to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of incorrectly calling at least one probeset differentially expressed.

RNA isolation from leukocyte subsets. One ml of whole blood was used for
immediate RNA isolation (internal validation step) using QIAamp RNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The remaining 10 ml whole blood was used to perform a ficoll density separation using Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway). Granulocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and immediately frozen at -80Â°C. From the PBMCs, CD14-positive cells (here referred to as monocytes) and CD14-negative cells, hence enriched for B- and T-cells (and therefore here referred to as lymphocytes) were separated using autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The integrity of the RNA was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano assay kit on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Micro-array analysis. Background was removed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and probe intensity levels were quantile normalized. Array groups were compared based on the perfect match (PM) probe intensity levels only, by performing a per-probeset two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, with factors âprobeâ and âgroupâ). This results in average expression levels for each probeset in each group, as well as raw p-values for the significance of the difference between the groups. The latter were adjusted for multiple testing using Â¬Å idÃ¡k step-up adjustment to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of incorrectly calling at least one probeset differentially expressed. All differences with adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The Ingenuity program was used to analyse what pathophysiological pathways were differentially expressed between patients at t=0 and controls (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; 5.5.1-1002).

Micro-array analysis. Background was removed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and probe intensity levels were quantile normalized. Array groups were compared based on the perfect match (PM) probe intensity levels only, by performing a per-probeset two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, with factors âprobeâ and âgroupâ). This results in average expression levels for each probeset in each group, as well as raw p-values for the significance of the difference between the groups. The latter were adjusted for multiple testing using Â¬Å idÃ¡k step-up adjustment to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of incorrectly calling at least one probeset differentially expressed. All differences with adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. The Ingenuity program was used to analyse what pathophysiological pathways were differentially expressed between patients at t=0 and controls (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; 5.5.1-1002).

    <Title>Gene expression profiling in pediatric meningococcal sepsis reveals dynamic changes in NK-cell and cytotoxic molecules</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE11755</Accession>
    <Summary>
Objective. Meningococcal sepsis remains an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. Largely due to logistic complexities of research in young children with acute life-threatening disease, very little is known regarding differential expression kinetics and molecular regulation of immune response genes in leukocyte subsets. 
Materials and methods. In this prospective case-control study, six children with meningococcal sepsis were included. Blood was drawn at four time points (t=0, t=8, t=24 and t=72 h after admission to the paediatric intensive care unit). Blood was also collected from matched controls. Detailed immunophenotyping of leukocytes was performed; RNA isolated from whole blood, lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes was used to perform Affymetrix micro-array gene expression analysis.
Results and conclusion. There were no differences in total leukocyte count between patients and controls. In contrast to previous in vitro studies we observed an unexpected decrease in NK cell numbers, as well as downregulation of NK cell specific and cytotoxic T-cell related gene expression in patients with meningococcal septic shock. By contrast, expression of genes, involved in innate immunity and several other pathways, differed between the different leukocyte subpopulations in a dynamic fashion. Compared to previously reported gene expression profiles, it was possible to define a meningococcal sepsis specific expression profile.
