Complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set plus 6,500 additional genes for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts
All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBankÂ®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001) and then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human genome database (April 2001 release).
In addition, there are 9,921 new probe sets representing approximately 6,500 new genes. These gene sequences were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 159, January 25, 2003) and refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the NCBI human genome assembly (Build 31).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted from whole blood samples using the PaxGene Blood RNA System (PreAnalytiX, Qiagen/Becton Dickson) according the manufacturerâs specifications.
Quality control steps:   RNA quality was assessed by using the Agilent bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and only those samples with 28S/18S ratios between 1.3 and 2 were subsequently used
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Labeling involved an in vitro transcription reaction using the ENZO BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) according to manufacturerâs instructions.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The image file was captured on an Affymetrix Gene Chip Scanner 3000
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Experimental factor value:  Day 1 samples = control, SIRS, or septic shock. Day 3 samples = SIRS, septic shock, or SIRS resolved
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

Experimental factor value:  Day 1 samples = control, SIRS, or septic shock. Day 3 samples = SIRS, septic shock, or SIRS resolved
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

Experimental factor value:  Day 1 samples = control, SIRS, or septic shock. Day 3 samples = SIRS, septic shock, or SIRS resolved
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

Experimental factor value:  Day 1 samples = control, SIRS, or septic shock. Day 3 samples = SIRS, septic shock, or SIRS resolved
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:  Create a hybridization cocktail for a single probe array that contains 0.05 ug/uL fragmented cRNA, 50 pM Control Oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix), 20X Eukaryotic Hybridization Controls (1.5 pM bioB, 5 pM bioC, 25 pM bioD, 100 pM cre) (Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/mL Acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and 1X Hybridization Buffer. Heat hybridization cocktail to 99Â°C for 5 minutes, to 45Â°C for 5 minutes, and spin at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. Fill probe array with 200 uL of 1X Hybridization Buffer. Incubate at 45Â°C for 10 minutes in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) rotating at 60 rpm. Remove 1X Hybridization Buffer and fill probe array with 200 uL of the hybridization cocktail. Incubate at 45Â°C for 16 hrs in the Hybridization Oven rotating at 60 rpm

    <Data-Processing>
Processed with Microarray suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) to generate .CEL files that were subject to RMA normalization (Irizarry et al 2003) using GeneSpring software.
Standard Affymetrix internal control genes were used to check the quality of the assay quality by the signals of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set of the internal control genes, GAPDH and B-actin, with acceptable 3' to 5' ratios between1-3. Prokaryotic Spike controls were used to determine the hybridization of target RNA to the array occurred properly.
GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent technologies Inc. Palo Alto, California) was used to normalization, Clustering and filtering. The Raw CEL files were processed using the RMA (Robust Multichip Average) built in GeneSpring software. All the samples were then normalized to the median of the controls

    <Summary>
Goal of the experiment:  To identify correlated genes, pathways and groups of patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and septic shock that is indicative of biologically important processes active in these patients.
Background:  We measured gene expression levels and profiles of children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and septic shock as a means for discovering patient sub-groups and gene signatures that are active in disease-affected individuals and potentially in patients with poor outcomes.
Methods:  Microarray and bioinformatics analyses of 123 microarray chips representing whole blood derived RNA from controls, children with SIRS, and children with septic shock.
Results:  A discovery-based filtering approach was undertaken to identify genes whose expression levels were altered in patients with SIRS or septic shock. Clustering of these genes identified 3 Major and several minor sub-groups of patients with SIRS or septic shock. The three groups differed with respect to incidence of septic shock and trended toward differences in mortality. Statistical analyses demonstrated that 6,435 gene probes were differentially regulated between the three patient sub-groups (false discovery rate &lt; 0.001%). Of these gene probes, 623 gene probes within 7 major gene ontologies accounted for the majority of group differentiation. Network analyses of these 623 gene probes demonstrated 5 major gene networks that were differentially expressed between the 3 groups. Statistical comparison of septic shock survivors and non-survivors identified one major gene network that was under expressed in a high fraction of the non-survivors and identified potential biomarkers for poor outcome.
Conclusions:  This is the first genome-level demonstration of pediatric patient sub-groups with SIRS and septic shock. The sub-groups differ clinically and differentially express 5 major gene networks. We have identified gene signatures and potential biomarkers associated with poor outcome in children with septic shock. These data represent a major advancement in our genome-level understanding of pediatric SIRS and septic shock.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Children &lt; 10 years of age admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and meeting the criteria for either SIRS or septic shock were eligible for the study. SIRS and septic shock were defined based on pediatric-specific criteria. We did not use separate categories of &quot;sepsis&quot; or &quot;severe sepsis&quot;. Patients meeting criteria for &quot;sepsis&quot; or &quot;severe sepsis&quot; were placed in the categories of SIRS and septic shock, respectively, for study purposes. Control patients were recruited from the outpatient or inpatient departments of the participating institutions using the following exclusion criteria:  a recent febrile illness (within 2 weeks), recent use of anti-inflammatory medications (within 2 weeks), or any history of chronic or acute disease associated with inflammation.
After obtaining informed consent, blood samples were obtained on Day 1 of the study, and when possible on Day 3 of the study. Blood samples were divided for RNA extraction and isolation of serum. Severity of illness was calculated based on the PRISM III score. Organ failure was defined based on pediatric-specific criteria. Annotated clinical and laboratory data were collected daily while in the intensive care unit. Study patients were placed in the study categories of SIRS or Septic Shock on Day 1 of the study. On Day 3 of the study, patients were classified as SIRS, Septic Shock, or SIRS resolved (no longer meeting criteria for SIRS). All study patients were followed for 28 days to determine mortality or survival. Clinical, laboratory, and biological data were entered and stored using a web-based data base developed locally.
