Title,Summary,Type,Overall-Design
Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of host molecular networks in neonatal sepsis,Expression profiling by array,We aimed to identify the gene network and pathway biology associated with neonatal sepsis by determining genome-wide alterations in host RNA in infected infants,Samples were obtained from control and infected human neonates.
