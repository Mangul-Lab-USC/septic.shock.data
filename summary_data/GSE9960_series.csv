Title,Summary,Type,Overall-Design
Gene-expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in sepsis,Expression profiling by array,"To identify signature genes that help distinguish (1) sepsis from non-infectious causes of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, (2) between Gram-positive and Gram-negative sepsis.
Keywords: Class prediction study","A total of 70 critically ill patients were enrolled in a single-centre observational study.  Gene-expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix microarray (U133plus2) with 54,675 transcript.  Data was divided into a training set (n=35) and a validation set (n=35).  A molecular signature was developed in the training set and was then validated in the validation set."
