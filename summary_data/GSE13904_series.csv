"Expression profiling across the pediatric systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock spectrum",Expression profiling by array,"Normal children, children with SIRS, children with sepsis, and children with septic shock.

Objectives: To advance our biological understanding of pediatric septic shock, we measured the genome-level expression profiles of critically ill children representing the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and septic shock spectrum.
Keywords: Normal vs diseased",Prospective observational study involving microarray-based bioinformatics.
