Expression data from validation cohort of children with septic shock,Expression profiling by array,"Background:  Septic shock heterogeneity has important implications for the conduct of clinical trials and individual patient management. We previously addressed this heterogeneity by indentifying 3 putative subclasses of children with septic shock based on a 100-gene expression signature corresponding to adaptive immunity and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Herein we attempted to prospectively validate the existence of these gene expression-based subclasses in a validation cohort. Methods:  Gene expression mosaics were generated from the 100 class-defining genes for 82 individual patients in the validation cohort. Patients were classified into 1 of 3 subclasses (“A”, “B”, or “C”) based on color and pattern similarity relative to reference mosaics generated from the original derivation cohort. Separate classifications were conducted by 21 individual clinicians and a computer-based algorithm. After subclassification the clinical database was mined for clinical phenotyping. Results:  In the final consensus subclassification generated by clinicians, subclass A patients had a higher illness severity, as measured by illness severity scores and maximal organ failure, relative to subclasses B and C. The k coefficient across all possible inter-evaluator comparisons was 0.633. Similar observations were made based on the computer-generated subclassification. Patients in subclass A were also characterized by repression of a large number of genes having functional annotations related to zinc biology. Conclusions:  We have validated the existence of subclasses of children with septic shock based on a biologically relevant, 100-gene expression signature. The subclasses can be indentified by clinicians without formal bioinformatics training, at a clinically relevant time point, and have clinically relevant phenotypic differences.","Expression data from 82 children with septic shock and 21 normal controls were generated using whole blood-derived RNA samples representing the first 24 hours of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. The controls were used for normalization. Subsequently, we used the expression data from 100 class defining genes to validate the existence of pediatric septic shock subclasses having phenotypic differences.",Children ≤ 10 years old,Homo sapiens,total RNA,GSE26378
Genome-wide blood transcriptional profiling in critically ill patients - MARS consortium,Expression profiling by array,"The host response in critically ill patients with sepsis, septic shock remains poorly defined. Considerable research has been conducted to accurately distinguish patients with sepsis from those with non-infectious causes of disease. Technological innovations have positioned systems biology at the forefront of biomarker discovery. Analysis of the whole-blood leukocyte transcriptome enables the assessment of thousands of molecular signals beyond simply measuring several proteins in plasma, which for use as biomarkers is important since combinations of biomarkers likely provide more diagnostic accuracy than the measurement of single ones or a few. Evidence suggests that genome-wide transcriptional profiling of blood leukocytes can assist in differentiating between infection and non-infectious causes of severe disease. Of importance, RNA biomarkers have the potential advantage that they can be measured reliably in rapid quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based point of care tests.","PAXgene blood RNA was isolated at intensive-care unit (ICU) admission and throughout ICU length-of-stay. Through the use of genome-wide microarrays we aimed to identify molecular features that enbale the adequate discrimination of infectious and non-infectious sources of critical illness. Patient diagnoses include community-acquired pneumonia (cap), hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) and non-infectious cap control patients (no-cap) (characteristics: pneumonia diagnoses).

Development and Validation of a Novel Molecular Biomarker Diagnostic Test for the Early Detection of Sepsis,Expression profiling by array,"Introduction: Sepsis is a complex immunological response to infection characterized by early hyperinflammation followed by severe and protracted immunosuppression, suggesting that a multi-marker approach has the greatest clinical utility for early detection, within a clinical environment focused on SIRS differentiation. Pre-clinical research using an equine sepsis model identified a panel of gene expression biomarkers that define the early aberrant immune activation. Thus, the primary objective was to apply these gene expression biomarkers to distinguish patients with sepsis from those who had undergone major open surgery and had clinical outcomes consistent with systemic inflammation due to physical trauma and wound healing.
Methods: This was a multi-centre, prospective clinical trial conducted across 4 tertiary critical care settings in Australia. Sepsis patients were recruited if they met the 1992 Consensus Statement criteria and had clinical evidence of systemic infection based on microbiology diagnoses (n=27). Participants in the post-surgical (PS) group were recruited pre-operatively and blood samples collected within 24 hours following surgery (n=38).  Healthy controls (HC) included hospital staff with no known concurrent illnesses (n=20). Each participant had minimally 5ml of PAXgene blood collected for leucocyte RNA isolation and gene expression analyses. Affymetrix array and multiplex tandem (MT)-PCR studies were conducted to evaluate transcriptional profiles in circulating white blood cells applying a set of 42 molecular markers that had been identified a priori. A LogitBoost algorithm was used to create a machine learning diagnostic rule to predict sepsis outcomes.
Results: Based on preliminary microarray analyses comparing HC and sepsis groups. A panel of 42-gene expression markers were identified that represented  key innate and adaptive immune function, cell cycling, WBC differentiation, extracellular remodelling and immune modulation pathways. Comparisons against GEO data confirmed the definitive separation of the sepsis cohort. Quantitative PCR results suggest the capacity for this test to differentiate severe systemic inflammation from HC is 92%. AUC ROC curve findings demonstrated sepsis prediction within a mixed inflammatory population, was between 86 - 92%.
Conclusions: This novel molecular biomarker test has a clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity profile, and has the capacity for early detection of sepsis via the monitoring of critical care patients.

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome and septic shock,Expression profiling by array,"Goal of the experiment:  To identify correlated genes, pathways and groups of patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and septic shock that is indicative of biologically important processes active in these patients.
Background:  We measured gene expression levels and profiles of children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and septic shock as a means for discovering patient sub-groups and gene signatures that are active in disease-affected individuals and potentially in patients with poor outcomes.
Methods:  Microarray and bioinformatics analyses of 123 microarray chips representing whole blood derived RNA from controls, children with SIRS, and children with septic shock.
Results:  A discovery-based filtering approach was undertaken to identify genes whose expression levels were altered in patients with SIRS or septic shock. Clustering of these genes identified 3 Major and several minor sub-groups of patients with SIRS or septic shock. The three groups differed with respect to incidence of septic shock and trended toward differences in mortality. Statistical analyses demonstrated that 6,435 gene probes were differentially regulated between the three patient sub-groups (false discovery rate < 0.001%). Of these gene probes, 623 gene probes within 7 major gene ontologies accounted for the majority of group differentiation. Network analyses of these 623 gene probes demonstrated 5 major gene networks that were differentially expressed between the 3 groups. Statistical comparison of septic shock survivors and non-survivors identified one major gene network that was under expressed in a high fraction of the non-survivors and identified potential biomarkers for poor outcome.
Conclusions:  This is the first genome-level demonstration of pediatric patient sub-groups with SIRS and septic shock. The sub-groups differ clinically and differentially express 5 major gene networks. We have identified gene signatures and potential biomarkers associated with poor outcome in children with septic shock. These data represent a major advancement in our genome-level understanding of pediatric SIRS and septic shock.

SIRS and septic shock were defined based on pediatric-specific criteria. We did not use separate categories of ""sepsis"" or ""severe sepsis"". Patients meeting criteria for ""sepsis"" or ""severe sepsis"" were placed in the categories of SIRS and septic shock, respectively, for study purposes. Control patients were recruited from the outpatient or inpatient departments of the participating institutions using the following exclusion criteria:  a recent febrile illness (within 2 weeks), recent use of anti-inflammatory medications (within 2 weeks), or any history of chronic or acute disease associated with inflammation.
After obtaining informed consent, blood samples were obtained on Day 1 of the study, and when possible on Day 3 of the study. Blood samples were divided for RNA extraction and isolation of serum. Severity of illness was calculated based on the PRISM III score. Organ failure was defined based on pediatric-specific criteria. Annotated clinical and laboratory data were collected daily while in the intensive care unit. Study patients were placed in the study categories of SIRS or Septic Shock on Day 1 of the study. On Day 3 of the study, patients were classified as SIRS, Septic Shock, or SIRS resolved (no longer meeting criteria for SIRS).

Pediatric septic shock,Expression profiling by array,"In an ongoing translational research program involving microarray-based expression profiles in pediatric septic shock, we have now conducted longitudinal studies focused on the temporal expression profiles of canonical signaling pathways and gene networks. Genome-level expression profiles were generated from whole blood-derived RNA samples of children with septic shock (n = 30 individual patients) corresponding to days 1 and 3 of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. Based on sequential statistical and expression filters, day 1 and day 3 of septic shock were characterized by differential regulation of 2,142 and 2,504 gene probes, respectively, relative to normal control patients. Venn analysis demonstrated 239 unique genes in the day 1 data set, 598 unique genes in the day 3 data set, and 1,906 genes common to both data sets. Analyses targeted toward derivation of biological function from these data sets demonstrated time-dependent, differential regulation of genes involved in multiple canonical signaling pathways and gene networks primarily related to immunity and inflammation. Notably, multiple and distinct gene networks involving T cell- and MHC antigen-related biological processes were persistently downregulated from day 1 to day 3. Further analyses demonstrated large scale and persistent downregulation of genes corresponding to functional annotations related to zinc homeostasis. These data represent the largest reported cohort of patients with septic shock, which has undergone longitudinal genome-level expression profiling. The data further advance our genome-level understanding of pediatric septic shock and support novel hypotheses that can be readily tested at both the experimental and translational levels.

Biomarker-based classification of bacterial and fungal whole-blood infections in a genome-wide expression study,Expression profiling by array,"Sepsis is a clinical syndrome that can be caused by bacteria or fungi. Early knowledge on the nature of the causative agent is a prerequisite for targeted anti-microbial therapy. Besides currently used detection methods like blood culture and PCR-based assays, the analysis of the transcriptional response of the host to infecting organisms holds great promise. In this study, we aim to examine the transcriptional footprint of infections caused by the bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and the fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus in a human whole-blood model. Moreover, we use the expression information to build a random forest classifier to determine if the pathogen is bacterial, fungal or neither of the two. After normalizing the transcription intensities using stably expressed reference genes, we filtered the gene set for biomarkers of bacterial or fungal blood infections. This selection is based on differential expression and an additional gene relevance measure. In this way, we identified 38 biomarker genes, including IL6, SOCS3, and IRG1 which were already associated to sepsis by other studies. Using these genes, we trained the classifier and assessed its performance. It yielded a 96% accuracy (sensitivities >93%, specificities >97%) for a 10-fold stratified cross-validation and a 92% accuracy (sensitivities and specificities >83%) for an additional dataset comprising Cryptococcus neoformans infections. Furthermore, the noise-robustness of the classifier suggests high rates of correct class predictions on datasets of new species. In conclusion, this genome-wide approach demonstrates an effective feature selection process in combination with the construction of a well-performing classification model. Further analyses of genes with pathogen-dependent expression patterns can provide insights into the systemic host responses, which may lead to new anti-microbial therapeutic advances.","Analysis of innate immune activation on the basis of gene expression of whole blood cells during ex vivo whole blood infection with bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli) and fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus) in comparison to mock-treated blood.",Whole blood,Homo sapiens,total RNA,GSE65088
Gene expression profiling in pediatric meningococcal sepsis reveals dynamic changes in NK-cell and cytotoxic molecules,Expression profiling by array,"Objective. Meningococcal sepsis remains an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. Largely due to logistic complexities of research in young children with acute life-threatening disease, very little is known regarding differential expression kinetics and molecular regulation of immune response genes in leukocyte subsets. 
Materials and methods. In this prospective case-control study, six children with meningococcal sepsis were included. Blood was drawn at four time points (t=0, t=8, t=24 and t=72 h after admission to the paediatric intensive care unit). Blood was also collected from matched controls. Detailed immunophenotyping of leukocytes was performed; RNA isolated from whole blood, lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes was used to perform Affymetrix micro-array gene expression analysis.
Results and conclusion. There were no differences in total leukocyte count between patients and controls. In contrast to previous in vitro studies we observed an unexpected decrease in NK cell numbers, as well as downregulation of NK cell specific and cytotoxic T-cell related gene expression in patients with meningococcal septic shock. By contrast, expression of genes, involved in innate immunity and several other pathways, differed between the different leukocyte subpopulations in a dynamic fashion. Compared to previously reported gene expression profiles, it was possible to define a meningococcal sepsis specific expression profile.","In this prospective case-control study, six children with meningococcal sepsis were included.

Discrimination of SIRS from Sepsis in Critically Ill Adults,Expression profiling by array,"Background: Systemic inflammation is a whole body reaction that can have an infection-positive (i.e. sepsis) or infection-negative origin. It is important to distinguish between septic and non-septic presentations early and reliably, because this has significant therapeutic implications for critically ill patients. We hypothesized that a molecular classifier based on a small number of RNAs expressed in peripheral blood could be discovered that would: 1) determine which patients with systemic inflammation had sepsis; 2) be robust across independent patient cohorts; 3) be insensitive to disease severity; and 4) provide diagnostic utility. The overall goal of this study was to identify and validate such a molecular classifier. Methods and Findings: We conducted an observational, non-interventional study of adult patients recruited from tertiary intensive care units (ICU). Biomarker discovery was conducted with an Australian cohort (n = 105) consisting of sepsis patients and post  -surgical patients with infection-negative systemic inflammation. Using this cohort, a four-gene classifier consisting of a combination of CEACAM4, LAMP1, PLA2G7 and PLAC8 RNA biomarkers was identified. This classifier, designated SeptiCyte® Lab, was externally validated using RT-qPCR and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in five cohorts (n = 345) from the Netherlands. Cohort 1 (n=59) consisted of unambiguous septic cases and infection-negative systemic inflammation controls; SeptiCyte® Lab gave an area under curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-1.00). ROC analysis of a more heterogeneous group of patients (Cohorts 2-5; 249 patients after excluding 37 patients with infection likelihood possible) gave an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93). Disease severity, as measured by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score or the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score, was not a significant confounding variable. The diagnostic utility o  f SeptiCyte® Lab was evaluated by comparison to various clinical and laboratory parameters that would be available to a clinician within 24 hours of ICU admission. SeptiCyte® Lab was significantly better at differentiating sepsis from infection-negative systemic inflammation than all tested parameters, both singly and in various logistic combinations. SeptiCyte® Lab more than halved the diagnostic error rate compared to PCT in all tested cohorts or cohort combinations. Conclusions: SeptiCyte® Lab is a rapid molecular assay that may be clinically useful in the management of ICU patients with systemic inflammation.

Marked alterations of neutrophil functions during sepsis-induced immunosuppression,Expression profiling by array,"Background: Severe septic syndromes deeply impair innate and adaptive immunity. While neutrophils represent the first line of defense against infection, little is known about their phenotype and functions during sepsis-induced immunosuppression. The objective of this study was thus to perform for the first time a global evaluation of neutrophil alterations in immunosuppressed septic patients based on phenotypic, functional and transcriptomic studies. In addition, the potential association of these parameters and deleterious outcomes was assessed.
Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 9 septic shock patients at D3-4 and D6-8 presenting with features of sepsis-induced immunosuppression and compared to 8 healthy controls.
Results: In order to get on overview of potential neutrophil alterations after sepsis, we performed transcriptomic analyses on purified neutrophils from 9 septic shock patients and 8 healthy volunteers. For each time point, comparisons were made between patients and controls. Venn diagrams indicated that 364 up-regulated genes and 328 down-regulated genes were common between the two analyses (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Interestingly, most of the differentially expressed genes are involved in cell maturation (CD177), apoptosis (STK4, Caspase 8), cell recruitment and chemotaxis (CD44, TPST, MMP9, CREB1), and antimicrobial properties (ARG1, STOM, ADAM9, CD63, YKL40) of neutrophils.
Conclusions: The aim of the current study was to perform an extensive investigation of neutrophil alterations during sepsis-induced immunosuppression through phenotypic, functional and transcriptomic studies.

The objective of this study was to investigate the systemic genomic response in severe Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients and determine whether patterns of gene expression could be associated with clinical severity evaluated by severity score.   Methods: Twenty-eight ICU patients were enrolled at the onset of septic shock. Blood samples were collected within 30 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after shock and genomic response was evaluated using microarrays. The genome wide expression pattern of blood leukocytes was sequentially compared to healthy volunteers and after stratification based on SAPSII score to identify potential mechanisms of dysregulation.   Results: Septic shock induces a global reprogramming of the whole leukocyte transcriptome affecting multiple functions and pathways (> 71% of the whole genome was modified). Most altered pathways were not significantly different between SAPSII-high and SAPSII-low groups of patients. However the magnitude and the duration of these alterations were different between these two groups. Importantly, we observed that the more severe patients did not exhibit the strongest modulation. This indicates that some regulation mechanisms leading to recovery seem to take place at early stage.   Conclusion: In conclusion, both pro- and anti-inflammatory processes, measured at the transcriptomic level, are induced within the very first hours after septic shock. Interestingly, the more severe patients did not exhibit the strongest modulation. This highlights that, not only the responses mechanisms by themself but mainly their early and appropriate regulation, are crucial for patient recovery. This reinforces the idea that an immediate and tailored aggressive care of patients, aimed at restoring an appropriately regulated immune response, may have a beneficial impact on outcome.","Twenty-eight ICU patients were enrolled at the onset of septic shock.

Gene Expression-Based Classifiers Identify Staphylococcus aureus Infection in Mice and Humans,Expression profiling by array,"Staphylococcus aureus causes a spectrum of human infection. Diagnostic delays and uncertainty lead to treatment delays and inappropriate antibiotic use. A growing literature suggests the host’s inflammatory response to the pathogen represents a potential tool to improve upon current diagnostics. The hypothesis of this study is that the host responds differently to S. aureus than to E. coli infection in a quantifiable way, providing a new diagnostic avenue. This study uses Bayesian sparse factor modeling and penalized binary regression to define peripheral blood gene-expression classifiers of murine and human S. aureus infection. The murine-derived classifier distinguished S. aureus infection from healthy controls and Escherichia coli-infected mice across a range of conditions (mouse and bacterial strain, time post infection) and was validated in outbred mice (AUC>0.97). A S. aureus classifier derived from a cohort of 95 human subjects distinguished S. aureus blood stream infection (BSI) from healthy subjects (AUC 0.99) and E. coli BSI (AUC 0.82). Murine and human responses to S. aureus infection share common biological pathways, allowing the murine model to classify S. aureus BSI in humans (AUC 0.84). Both murine and human S. aureus classifiers were validated in an independent human cohort (AUC 0.95 and 0.94, respectively).  The approach described here lends insight into the conserved and disparate pathways utilized by mice and humans in response to these infections.  Furthermore, this study advances our understanding of S. aureus infection; the host response to it; and identifies new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues.","To create a host gene expression-based classifier for S. aureus infection, mice from a variety of experimental conditions were utilized.  Seven different strains of inbred mice (n=187 total) were challenged with four different S. aureus strains via intraperitoneal inoculation and sacrificed at various time points as described in Methods.  The comparator group for model derivation included 50 A/J or C57BL/6J mice inoculated with E. coli (O18:K1:H7) as well as 54 uninfected mice. Next, the murine S. aureus classifier was externally validated in outbred CD-1 mice with S. aureus infection (Sanger 476 or USA300), E. coli infection (O18:K1:H7), or uninfected controls (10 animals per condition).   Method: All experiments were performed on mice 6-8 weeks old.  For the murine S. aureus predictor, seven inbred mouse strains (3 mice/strain: 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and NOD/LtJ) were IP inoculated with 107 CFU/g of S. aureus Sanger476, euthanized at 2h after injection, and bled. This was repeated using four different S. aureus strains (USA100, USA300, MW2, and Sanger476) in A/J mice (n=3 per S. aureus strain). For time series experiments, both A/J and C57BL/6J mouse strains were IP inoculated with S. aureus Sanger476 as above, and sacrificed at 2, 4, 6, and 12h after injection (n=5 per time point).","blood 129S1/SvImJ mouse strain NOT infected, blood 129S1/SvImJ mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood A/J mouse strain NOT infected, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 24 hours after infection with E. coli, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus MW2, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 4 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 6 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 12 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus USA100, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus USA300, blood AKR/J mouse strain NOT infected, blood AKR/J mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood BALB/cBy mouse strain NOT infected, blood BALB/cBy mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood C3H/HeJ mouse strain NOT infected, blood C3H/HeJ mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood C57BL/6J mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood C57BL/6J mouse strain NOT infected, blood C57BL/6J mouse strain blood taken 24 hours after infection with E. coli, blood C57BL/6J mouse strain blood taken 4 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood C57BL/6J mouse strain blood taken 6 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood C57BL/6J mouse strain blood taken 12 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood NOD/ShiLtJ mouse strain NOT infected, blood NOD/ShiLtJ mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with E. coli, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 6 hours after infection with E. coli, blood A/J mouse strain blood taken 12 hours after infection with E. coli, blood C57BL/6J mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with E. coli, blood C57BL/6J mouse strain blood taken 6 hours after infection with E. coli, blood C57BL/6J mouse strain blood taken 12 hours after infection with E. coli, blood CD1 mouse strain NOT infected, blood CD1 mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus Sanger476, blood CD1 mouse strain blood taken 2 hours after infection with S. aureus USA300, blood CD1 mouse strain blood taken 24 hours after infection with E. coli, blood patient with E. coli bacteremia prior antibiotic treatment (Emergency Department), blood patient with S. aureus bacteremia prior antibiotic treatment (Emergency Department), blood human NOT infected","Mus musculus, Homo sapiens",total RNA,GSE33341
An Endotoxin Tolerance Signature Predicts Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction at Initial Clinical Presentation,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Background: Sepsis involves aberrant immune responses to infection, but the exact nature of this immune dysfunction remains poorly defined. Bacterial endotoxins like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are potent inducers of inflammation, which has been associated with the pathophysiology of sepsis, but repeated exposure can also induce a suppressive effect known as endotoxin tolerance or cellular reprogramming. It has been proposed that endotoxin tolerance might be associated with the immunosuppressive state that was primarily observed during late-stage sepsis. However, this relationship remains poorly characterised. Here we clarify the underlying mechanisms and timing of immune dysfunction in sepsis. 
Methods: We defined a gene expression signature characteristic of endotoxin tolerance. Gene-set test approaches were used to correlate this signature with early sepsis, both newly and retrospectively analysing microarrays from 593 patients in 11 cohorts. Then we recruited a unique cohort of possible sepsis patients at first clinical presentation in an independent blinded controlled observational study to determine whether this signature was associated with the development of confirmed sepsis and organ dysfunction. 
Findings: All sepsis patients presented an expression profile strongly associated with the endotoxin tolerance signature (p < 0.01; AUC 96.1%). Importantly, this signature further differentiated between suspected sepsis patients who did, or did not, go on to develop confirmed sepsis, and predicted the development of organ dysfunction. 
Interpretation: Our data support an updated model of sepsis pathogenesis in which endotoxin tolerance-mediated immune dysfunction (cellular reprogramming) is present throughout the clinical course of disease and related to disease severity. Thus endotoxin tolerance might offer new insights guiding the development of new therapies and diagnostics for early sepsis.","For the RNA-Seq study reported here, 73 patients were recruited with deferred consent at the time of first examination in an emergency ward based on the opinion of physicians that there was a potential for the patient's condition to develop into sepsis. These were retrospectively divided into groups based on clinical features and compared to 11 non-urgent surgical controls.","whole blood_No Sepsis T0, whole blood_Sepsis T0, whole blood_Control T0",Homo sapiens,total RNA,GSE63311
